# Hey y'all, I'm Andrew Couch :wave:

I'm a data scientist who enjoys MMA, politics, and teaching data science. I currently have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AndrewCouch/">YouTube Channel </a> where I post weekly videos going over machine learning, NLP, and data visualization using the Tidyverse and Tidymodels.
